**Project scope:**

**Short version:** A study space booking application on android platform

**Long version:**

The project is a study space booking android application developed for students to book seats in NUS libraries and for the NUS library management office to better manage the study spaces. The first stage is to develop the application using a local SQLite database and implementing basic features including sign-in, sign-out, and booking. In the second stage, other core features such as the credit system and user-management policies would be implemented and we would use an online server and firebase instead.

**Target Users:** NUS Students and NUS Library Management Office

**Problem motivation:**

1. Students often seem to have trouble finding seats in the study space in NUS. There are several reasons accounting for this. Firstly, there is a high demand for study space among the students, while the study space on campus is limited to a few locations such as the central library and ERC. Secondly, there seems to be a common practice of chopping seats using personal belongings among the students, which further increases the difficulty to find a free seat which is neither occupied by any students or their belongings.

2. Another problem is that some equipment in the study rooms does not seem to have been well maintained, such as light and sockets. This can affect the user experience. However, it might be a bit troublesome for the students themselves to report these problems to the office on time.

3. Based on these observations, we propose to create a mobile application. This application should enable students to find free seats and make bookings in advance. This feature can make finding free seats less troublesome and time-consuming. Additionally, this application should provide a platform for students to report maintenance problems. This feature can help administrators to identify maintenance problems and improve user experience. We also plan to establish a credit record system to keep track of misconduct of the students when using these facilities, such as seat chopping, to regulate the student behaviour. Additionally, the reason why we choose to build a mobile application is that a mobile application is usually convenient to use and students can make bookings whenever and wherever they want.

**User Story:**

1. As a student who wants to find a seat in the ERC study or central library, I want to be able to check whether there are vacancies and book seats in advance without having to spend time going to the specific locations.

1. As the administrator from the management office, I want to be able to get reports from users on the broken facilities and plan the repairing and maintaining process to take place.
2. As an administrator who wants to eliminate the behaviour of occupying seats, I want to be able to identify abusers who do not come even though they have booked seats, warn them and ban them from booking seats if they continue to behave in this way.

**Core features:**

**Students** :

1. Sign in

3. Select a certain study space, such as PC Commons in University Town, and set the start time and end time for their booking to view the vacancies in that particular study space and time slot.

The user can only book one seat during a period of time.

6. Sign out to the booked seat within 30 minutes of the scheduled end time of the booking by scanning QR code

7. Leave temporarily by scanning the QR code. The student needs to come back within 0.5 hour and sign in again by scanning the QR code.

8. View future bookings to remind the students to sign in to the seat on time, and call off the booking if necessary

**Credit System:**

1. The student will be given 10 credit points initially, and 1 point will be deducted for every misconduct, such as being unable to show up for the booking. The credit points will be refreshed monthly.

1. Students must sign in by scanning QR code within 15 minutes, or the booking would be cancelled and 1 point would be deducted.

1. Students must leave by scanning QR code within 30 minutes from the end of their booking period, or 1 point would be deducted.

1. Leave temporarily: Scan the QR code and choose to leave temporarily, the user needs to come back in 0.5 hours and sign-in by scanning the QR code. If the user did not manage to come back and rescan the QR code within 30 minutes, 1 point would be deducted.

1. Submit problem report with a photo and a short description. If the problem report is valid and reviewed by admins, the admin will add 1 credit to the user.

1. The user would be blocked when credit is 0 and has to wait for next month to refresh the credit.

**Administrators:**

1. Sign in

2. Search for a user to see the credit record and booking history according to the name of the user

**Necessary Technologies Involved:**

1: Git

2. Android Studio

3. Java

4. SQLite

5. Material Design

6. Firebase

**Testing:**

The testing used so far is primarily system testing, which means many of the testings are done by the developers. However, we have also invited ten NUS student users to have done alpha testing for our application.

Testing log:

1. It was found that there could be duplicate user accounts with the same school email address. This problem is addressed by imposing more restrictions on the registration and sign-in process.
2. The time format for the pending bookings shown in the user home page is previously not correct. The booking start time and booking end time are stored in the database in the form of an offset of seconds from a specific time point in the past. It was found that there was an overflow issue when the time in the database is retrieved and converted to milliseconds. This problem is solved by using long integer instead of a normal integer.
3. For the retrieval of problem report from firebase, it was found that firebase methods work asynchronously, and the result returned sequentially after the method call will have empty content. This problem is solved by using the listener.
4. For the submission of problem report, it was found that a user may click the submit button multiple times after the first click, which will result in duplicate reports submitted. This problem is solved by preventing submitting one report in the process of submitting another report.
5. For the user interface of the registration, the text fields were originally too long and occupied the entire width space of the page. This problem is solved by adding constraints to the left and right of the text area.
6. For the seat booking activities, originally we did not think of what if a user book a seat at overlapping timeslots at two different places. We solved this problem by adding more restrictions to the booking seat activities.
7. For the alert dialogues shown in the app, we found that the default theme was not suitable for us when we changed our theme to the dark theme. Thus, suggested by our test users, we implemented personalized alert dialogue themes.
8. For the bookings list views, users suggested that instead of plain text, we can also add a picture of the library that the seat is located at. This is convenient for some users who might not be so familiar with the library. Thus, we have implemented a photo of the specific library that match the location of the booking.
9. As for the admin activities, we also faced a privacy issue. As admins could look up the using history of a certain seat. Users might not want admins to directly see their student numbers by looking up the history of a certain seat. Thus, we let admins only see user IDs instead of user names. We have also rewrite the user searching activity so that admins can also deduct points of a certain user if either user ID or user name is known.
10. For the UI of the application. At first, we used the default UI design, however, we found that a darker UI seems to be a better design. The dark colour theme looks better. Thus we tried out different colour combinations and decided to implement the dark colour theme instead.

**Plan for the next phase:**

1. Do more system testing to find possible loopholes in our application and improve its stability

2. Optimize the performance of our application, especially regarding the writing and retrieval of information from the internet

3. Do more user testing
